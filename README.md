### Welcome to my neck of the woods
I have a BS in Applied Economics from Cornell University, where I gained experience modeling commodity crop data for farmer-facing products, and put into practice my expertise in statistics and finance.

I also previously analyzed housing market data for a bank that lended on securitized assets of non-bank Financial Institutions (NBFI). There, I made financing recommendations to the risk team based on my findings.

#### General Experience:
- Data management and analysis with Python;
  leveraged relevant libraries for data visualization, and machine learning for predictive model construction
- Managed large datasets using SQL
- Managed data science projects with git
