    "As Americans, we have an enormous variety of foods commonly available at grocery stores, corner shops, and increasingly, online. For one project, I'd like to take a look at the fundamental ingredients and nutrients that compose this great variety. My hope would be to predict the number of nutrients found in certain food items, as well as looking hollistically at the ingredients that are most common in our foods. I would like to then relate this to general dietary habits of the US population, and get a granular idea of the nutrient composition of diets. The stretch goal would be to predict the changes in nutrient-use given an increasing population of vegans, where I could estimate increases in required nutrient needs based on 'normal' diets. I'm unsure whether this would be kosher, because obviously I can't check the quality of my predictions for the future. I could, however, see if I could predict correlations on historical data in growth of the vegan diet in the US, and then use that model to predict the effect of future growth of vegan diets.\n",

    "Alternatively, I could look at pricing these ingredients, based on the foodtypes that we find them in. For example, take a chili sauce. Of this sauce, take a look at the unique ingredients, and their respective portion size in the sauce. Let's say that black beans compose 20% of the chili, and the chili runs 5 dollars/unit. Then the pricing for the black bean ingredient would be 1 dollar.\n",

    "From there, I would want to observe how expensive these ingredients can get and how their prices change depending on what products they may be found in. \n",
