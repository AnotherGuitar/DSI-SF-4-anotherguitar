    "About four months ago, I made a significant personal dietary change - by 'going vegan.' Though I had fully expected the difficulties that would come with my regular grocery shopping, I was honestly surprised to discover how difficult it was to source meals on the go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best resources that currently exist are apps like Yelp and Foursquare. However, a quick search for vegan items on either of these apps surfaces, at best, a few restaurants that may or may not actually serve vegan dishes. Why? Reviews or tips by disgruntled vegan users may be surfaced - not relevant venues. Other times, you are forced to look through menu after menu searching for items that might fit the dietary requirements. Worse yet, you are only able to search through nearby venues, even if you were willing to take public transportation a few stops to find suitable options. These issues stem principally from the approach that existing products take to sourcing meals, namely by locating relevant venues. But as might be obvious, one can often locate vegan dishes at omnivorous venues, not just at exclusively vegan ones. So I set out to instead prioritize what has thusly been overlooked: the dishes themselves. For my project, I hope to predict whether or not a particular menu item is vegan. By building a relatively robust predictive model, I could then see a few direct to consumer business opportunities. For example, I could create a Foursquare-esque competitor that would surface strictly menu items predicted to be vegan. To improve the quality of results, I would suggest adding user inputs, such as a voting mechanism, as a check to corroborate the predicted options surfaced via my model. Alternatively, I would hope to leverage my work to create a simple widget that would surface likely food groups (for example, if the item has dairy/eggs) when provided a user inputted food item. I could also give a prediction regarding whether the item was vegan, so it could have utility for quickly researching a novel item found at a particular venue."

    "The crux of the issue for any hungry vegan on the move is not necessarily which venue to frequent, as that is a luxury reserved for the omnivorous. Rather, it is even more fundamental: can I find a dish that I will actually be able to order? In looking to address this issue, vegans often cannot discriminate venues but need to evaluate their options on a dish-to-dish basis, across a variety of venues and menus. For that reason, I chose to first investigate where I might be able to find complete menu information for particular venues. Upon satisfying that requisite, I could move on to build a model that would automatically pick out which items were likely to be vegan, or not."

    "A vegan diet restricts an individual to eat only within the realm of goods that can be considered not to have been produced with or by any animal products. As such, my methodology for defining particular food items was to first batch them into tangible food groups, which could then be referenced to better understand how machine learning techniques are predicting particular items to be vegan, and others not to be."

    "Knowing that Yelp had a reasonably comprehensive open API, I first pondered the possibility of collecting menu information from them. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that the amount of granular, item-by-item menu information that Yelp had was minimal - in turn making my project a virtual no-go.\n",

    "I subsequently turned to Foursquare, which to my surprise had indexed an incredible number of menus across the venues that they surface via organic search. My curiosity had been peaked. How was it possible that Foursquare had such reliable, well-organized data on their platform around menus, when Yelp did not? After some additional research, I learned that Foursquare had a partnership with a significant third-party reseller of small-business information, named Locu (https://locu.com/). As it turned out, Locu itself had an open API that was relatively accessible years ago, but that was shut off to the public after it was acquired by GoDaddy. Even after some digging, I was sadly unable to come up with "

Unfortunately, I discovered early on that a) I would be capped from collecting as many menu items from unique menus as I needed (at least several thousand items in toto) and b) I wouldn't be able to collect menus from as many venues as I had originally hoped. On the bright side, I did notice that it would be possible to collect a significant number (thousands) of urls identifying unique venue menus. So even though I wouldn't be able to easily collect my data through a handful of API calls, it might have been possible to scrape the Foursquare menu urls themselves..."
